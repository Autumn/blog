Time sure flies.

Exactly one year ago, I applied for one year of leave from my studies at university. I was so ecstatic that I blogged about my motivations and hopes for the time off. Now, that time is almost up, and it's time to see just how far I've come since.

#### Before The Beginning ####

At the time, around May, I was pretty single-minded in my plan. Take the time off, study Japanese every day, become amazing. Sounds pretty simple on the screen. Of course, becoming a wizard in any particular skill requires a bit more work than a three-step plan. 

And I had more than a three-step plan! Although technically it was a three-step plan. Japanese, in its essence, has three things at its core. Kanji, grammar and vocabulary. So the plan was to study the kanji and the grammar concurrently, then move onto vocabulary and core reading afterwards. 

Tackling the kanji is no small feat though. Fortunately, I came across some magic in John Heisig's [Remembering the Kanji](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi) series. While opinion on the internet is divided on the usefulness of his method, I tend to refer to it as the Win Method. A shortcut and stepping stone to mastering the kanji. The kanji were mine.

Grammar wasn't much of a worry. I just purchased the [Dictionary of Japanese Grammar](http://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Basic-Japanese-Grammar/dp/4789004546) series and planned to revise a new section every day. 

Vocabulary was a niggling issue, but I'd deal with it after I finished the kanji. By then, ideally I'd have gotten a reasonable way through the grammar as well.

Tying all of these things together though, is a method. That method was Spaced Repetition Software. This type of software aims to optimise your memory, presenting facts to you when you're on the cusp of forgetting them. If you're closing this tab at this point, this is the one thing you should take away from this. Structure your learning around Spaced Repetition, and you will reap the benefits. You don't need any other type of studying.

#### The Beginning ####

End of June, 2012. Final university exams had finished, and I was free for an entire year. I gave myself three weeks of leisure time before I'd start working seriously.

You've probably guessed where this is going. Turns out, executing a plan is like writing a blog post. Ideas come flowing, you easily model the flow in your mind, and you just never seem to get around to starting it. Turns out, leisure is a bit too appealing, after being overwhelmed by work and uni for so long.

Uh oh. Come August, it's time for a serious kick in the ass. You can barely read Japanese, let alone at speed. You're so bad, you can't even remember the polite form of する. (This actually happened in a conversation and it was pretty embarrassing). What do you really want?

August, I finally started. Lazily working through the RTK book. Initially, I was working through one chapter a sitting: creating the flash cards necessary, then studying them later. This, in retrospect, was not the most efficient method, and I could have saved time in the order of **months** if I did it the way I discovered later. 

I also completely neglected the grammar study. Who would have thought studying grammar from the dictionary would be hopelessly, mind-numbingly boring? Not even a hardened MMORPG grind professional like myself could handle such a grind.

Time goes on. I continued my study in a simple way. [I bought my first light novel](http://www.amazon.co.jp/%E5%83%95%E3%81%AF%E5%8F%8B%E9%81%94%E3%81%8C%E5%B0%91%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84-MF%E6%96%87%E5%BA%ABJ-%E5%B9%B3%E5%9D%82-%E8%AA%AD/dp/4840128790/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1369267879&sr=8-1&keywords=%E5%83%95%E3%81%AF%E5%8F%8B%E9%81%94%E3%81%8C%E5%B0%91%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84), and tried reading it through the meanings of the kanji. Fun, but ultimately fruitless. A reminder that even after completely RtK, there's still a long way to go. The path extends.

#### After The Kanji ####

November 12th, 2012. I had successfully learned the meanings of 2200 kanji. I reached my first milestone! The time had come to focus on the most important area of learning language - vocabulary!

At this point, I hadn't devised a way to study vocabulary. I started with reading manga and making flash cards of unknown words, finding a sentence with each word in it. The problem here was scalability - the resources at my disposal weren't error prone, there were too many unknown words making sentences difficult to comprehend, and my limited understanding of grammar made longer, complex sentences basically indecipherable. Note that I hadn't done any vocabulary or grammar study during the entire time I was studying kanji. I felt that was a mistake while doing it, and looking back, I definitely could have used that time better. 

But you have to make do. I managed to find a very useful resource on the internet - a Google doc with 6000 common words. I'd struck learning gold! With a little clicking, I'd imported the .csv into Anki and created a 6000-word deck in little over a minute. This was the next goal!

I think I started the deck in late November or early December. I can't recall the exact date. I'm fairly sure I began with 25 new words a day. Every day. That was pretty manageable, so I bumped it up to 30 pretty soon. 

#### Disaster ####

Unfortunately, around a month into this new deck, I made a serious mistake that jeapardised months of study. I missed a day of my old kanji deck. The problem, if you'd call it such, lies with the essence of spaced repetition. The software automatically determines when you're set to forget, and it was determined that I was to forget over 300 kanji that day. That's a lot of kanji, especially when you have 200 words to revise. A very intimidating number to see in the morning, when gauging your workload. And if you miss it, the next day, you have two days of work to catch up on. 

I told myself I'd "do it tomorrow".

With a single inaction, I undid three months of study. I knew it was an error, but I did it anyway. Within a few days, I'd forsaken any chance of recovering from it. I stopped revising my kanji deck, and learned a serious lesson.

Never miss a day.

#### A Marathon, Not A Sprint ####

Fortunately, I did learn this lesson. I went on holiday in Malaysia for 2 weeks. I had a 12-hour shift every Sunday. I went camping with friends, with no electricity. I never missed a day of my vocabulary deck. 

Not that I knew that at the time, of course. I eventually upped my deck to 40 new words a day, calculating that I would have finished the 6000 words completely by the middle of May. While studying, I increased my manga collection, noting down the unknown words to study them after the current list was done. 

On May 13th, 2013, I finally finished my long journey. Aw yeah.

#### Analysis ####

So after all that, where am I? With a little typing, I analysed the frequency of kanji covered in my word deck. The results are surprising:

- Words: 6000
- Unique Kanji - ~1710

Whaaaaat? After all that time, I hadn't even covered all the joyo kanji? Talk about a rip off! The reality isn't that bad, however. Each kanji potentially has multiple readings. That statistic is a lot harder to analyse. 

A negative characteristic of the deck, which I noticed very early on, was sentence monotony. An example of this is as follows. The kanji 彼 was used 1243 times. Accounting for repetition, that's roughly 1200 sentences of the structure "he did something". Basically, the sentence complexity of this deck was, frankly, atrocious. That's what happens when you grab a resource from the internet without checking it thoroughly. 

Another issue with the deck was that a lot of words are completely useless to me, at this stage of learning. Words like 小児科 (pediatrics), which I'm confident in saying that they will never turn up in the material I'll be experiencing for a long time, are pointless.

All these characteristics are soft though. Let's get some hard data, right from the Anki deck analysis. Anki provides all sorts of statistics from the deck data, but the most important one is the Answer Button statistic.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/img/anki-retention.png" class="center-image" />

This records the number of times you press the "Again", "Hard", "Easy" and "Very Easy" buttons for each card. It effectively measures retention rate. What we can see here, is a retention rate of over 90% for previous words, and over 80% for brand new words. 

I don't know how to contain my excitement around SRS after seeing these numbers! Gaining this sort of retention just by seeing the word once every while? It's nothing short of incredible. If you needed any more evidence to change your study routine to an SRS-centric routine, then let this be it. 

So where did this get me, after a mere 5 months? From a fistful of words at the beginning of December, to over 6000 now, I've come from struggling to read basic things, to confidence and speed when reading most arbitrary things. Sure, the result of a low sentence complexity means complex sentences are harder to understand, but I'll overcome that with more practice. I have a plan to conquer that, of course.

My final score, for completeness:

- Kanji Forgotten: ~2000 (conservative estimate)
- Words Learned: ~7000 (liberal estimate) 
- Manga Volumes Read: 19

#### Current Plans ####

Now that that's all finished, what do I plan to do? This isn't the end of the journey, after all, just the next step. 

First is continuing to revise my word deck so the daily burden is lessened to approximately 50 words a day. The statistics say this will take another week.

Afterwards, I have a long list of words that I wrote down from all my manga volumes. You thought I forgot about them? I'm planning to make flash cards out of 4koma panels, which will keep it interesting.

I'm currently working on a project to relearn the kanji. Instead of the traditional Heisig method, I'm mapping each card to its definition in Japanese. It's time to go monolingual.

You might notice that I completely deserted studying the grammar exclusively. What blasphemy! Studying grammar points is crucial to forging mastery in a foreign language, right? In short, no. There's a good quote from Stephen Krashen, [whose views on language acquisition you should really pay attention to](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shgRN32ubag), where he says something along the lines of "The only time you ever use grammar is in a grammar test.". He also says a lot of insightful things. You should really watch that video.

That's not to say I've just abandoned my purchase of those grammar dictionaries. They were expensive, after all! I'm currently entering each example sentence into a flash card deck. Pretty tedious, but like the kanji deck, it should be beneficial in the long run as a head start over grammar. Because I'm not learning grammar, I'm reading sentences.

I'm reading a lot! I have a long bookshelf to conquer, with lots of content to learn on the way there. My wishlist on amazon.co.jp is getting a bit long, too. 

My startup project is closely related to the previous point. I'm pretty confident it's a viable product with a sustainable business behind it. Get excited. :)

Oh, most importantly, I'm having fun. Learning a new language is tiring and tedious, but above all, it's incredibly enjoyable. Feeling the click of comprehension as you read a novel, or hear lines in anime, is unbeatable.

#### Conclusion ####

A year after declaring my intent to learn Japanese, I've been all over the place. I've been motivated, lazy, critical, optimistic, pessimistic. But I worked through it. And I'm here. There have been failures. There have been less than optimal performances. My methods haven't been perfect. But this form of analysis paralysis is the wrong way to look at it. There's no magic wand to daunting tasks, like learning a new language, or picking up an instrument, or doing anything foreign and new. The way to achieve your goal is to do something towards it. Doing something is better than doing nothing. The key is getting started. You will improve your methods as you go along. And you'll learn and improve things about yourself on the way.

#### Notes ####

My thoughts on this are hardly new, or even my own. I was really inspired by [Khatzumoto's All Japanese All The Time blog](http://www.alljapaneseallthetime.com). If you're learning a language, I recommend reading his entire blog. It's not just applicable to Japanese, or even language learning. It's all about having the determination to find what you seek. It's about shifting your perspective from "Oh, if only I could do something, if only I had the opportunity!" to "I will create the opportunity.". The power to forge your own path. Thank you, Khatzumoto, for getting me started on this journey.

Interested in SRS? Hit up [SuperMemo](http://www.supermemo.com) for a lot of resources on the theory, then go to [the Anki website](http://ankisrs.net) for the software. Spaced repetition is God Mode for real life.
