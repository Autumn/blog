If you keep an ear out for technology news, you would have no doubt heard about [Google's Chromebook Pixel](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromebook-pixel/), their latest entry into the hardware world and attempt to create a reference model for the budding Chromebook brand. While one can hardly argue with the high quality hardware and sleek design, the general consensus, which I mostly agree with, is that it's a $1500 web browser. Hardly the most cost effective purchase, especially for someone on a low income and saving goals.

But then during my daily Flipboarding, I came across an interesting article, which in hindsight I should have searched for immediately - [we can install Linux on the Chromebook Pixel](http://www.engadget.com/2013/02/23/chromebook-pixel-linux-unverified-bios-slot-custom-bootloader/ "Sorry about the Engadget link, it was in the generic \"Technology\" page."). [Google have also submitted kernel patches for the trackpad and touchscreen](http://www.muktware.com/5261/linux-kernel-patches-pixel). As I've been considering a laptop solely for development, this tickled my fancy and got me thinking about the possibility that I could use this device as more than a web browser. I came up with a few points that really resonate with me, and make the Chromebook Pixel look like a very suitable laptop.

#### The Display is Fantastic

The highlight of the Chromebook Pixel, no surprise, is the fantastic 2560 x 1700 239 PPI 12.85" touchscreen display it features. Another interesting feature is hidden behind the 12.85" screen size, is its 3:2 aspect ratio. In contrast to the 16:9 widescreen displays most people are accustomed to, the Chromebook Pixel optimises for a vertical orientation. Clearly designed for optimal web browsing, this use case has a fortunate side effect: it's also optimal for development. Having more vertical screen estate is ideal, whether it's for scrolling through your language documentation, or trying to grok a long function or set of. 

Featuring a touchscreen is a shrewed move, [one that all but forces Apple's hand](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-57570862-94/google-laptop-shows-apple-a-thing-or-two/), and validates Microsoft's touch-first strategy. I'm a huge fan of the touch paradigm, but naturally, it will be minimally useful in a development context, until some clever developers come along at least.

#### Mobile is the Future

Providing an LTE model is very appealing, and it highlights the trend: we're increasingly mobile in our computing. No one likes being tethered to their desks, which is why we have laptops and tablets. Similarly, we all hate having to rely on WiFi for data. Especially here in Australia where free WiFi is the exception, not the rule, unlike many other places in the world. With no leading force pushing for WiFi coverage in the cities (Why would Telstra do this, when their LTE network is [obscenely profitable and popular](http://www.telstra.com.au/abouttelstra/media-centre/announcements/telstra-delivers-on-commitments-guidance-confirmed.xml), we're left with 3G, horribly congested in most places, or LTE. LTE is clearly the future of mobile networks for the time being, so featuring it is very tempting. However, it remains to be seen whether it works with Linux yet, as the LTE models have not shipped out.

Dual -band WiFi 802.11a is a nice touch, too.

#### Bring on the Cloud

Some might see the 32GB limit as a deal breaker (64GB on the LTE model), but that's ignoring the reality of the cloud. No one enjoys transferring files manually between devices, sending emails to themselves to transfer files, or the horror/inconvenience of not having the right file for the right time. Cloud sync eliminates this completely, and you have a myriad of options when it comes to cloud sync. Personally, I use DropBox as it's more flexible than Google Drive, but a 1TB subscription to Drive for free is a nice touch. Given this is a development laptop, the space issue should be a non-issue. (TeX Live is more than 2GB though, so maybe you'll have a few problems. YMMV)

#### The Small Touches, and the Small Issues

The Chromebook Pixel does a lot of small things right. Backlit keyboard, glass trackpad, high quality industrial design, highlighting many good trends the industry nowadays. However, there are a few niggling downsides which puzzle me. USB 2.0? In a world where [you can get a 64GB USB 3.0 flash drive for ~$65](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/11/a-ssd-in-your-pocket.html), with _incredible_ performance, one can't help but think this was a cost cutting measure. Sure, the target market doesn't care for such things. But for such an expensive, high quality product, it's these small things that matter. One must note that the Apple Macbook Pro and Macbook Air both have USB 3.0. 

Another issue is the battery life. Pixels cost power, and driving a high pixel density display requires a lot of it. But I can't help but feel that 5 hours of battery is a little on the short side. On the other hand, you could time your working sessions by the battery life, and then go and relax when your battery is dead. Overworking never did anyone any good.

I'll mention processing speed and RAM out of obligation, but in essence they don't really matter. A dual core i5 with sufficient RAM can do pretty much anything you need it to, in the scope of development. It might not be able to compile OpenOffice, but it should be able to handle your projects or run a few Rails instances.

I should finish with a few words about Chrome OS. It might feel shallow and underpowered at the moment, but I believe that it's ahead of its time. The browser is the gateway to the Internet - and by extension our computing. Making the browser the OS removes all the intermediate steps for the vast majority of users who don't care for them, making the experience better in the meantime. With Native Client, and the increasing power of standardised web technologies, the browser is quickly becoming just as capable as more "full-featured" operating systems. It's a simple question of economics from here.

#### Conclusion

The Chromebook Pixel is a fantastic device that has fully functional Linux drivers. With no glaring flaws, all of its shortcomings are addressable, or even non-issues. Fantastic industrial design and reasonable hardware make for a solid machine. The possibility for dual booting allows a curious user to use Chrome OS, multitasking your development machine as an idle browsing machine. While some might see this as an unholy union, it at least saves you from having to buy a Nexus 10 or iPad. 

Last, but not least, you get a quality device without shelling any money to Apple. :P
