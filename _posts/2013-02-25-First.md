title: First, and hopefully not last.

After all this time, I've finally started my blog. Took a bit of effort, but it's here. Now I just have to write for it. That's a whole different story. But I got the site template done, that's good enough.

Still got some work to do on the site, but I had the urge to write an article today so beta is better than nothing. That's one of the many meanings behind the title, after all. It's about time I appreciated it enough to release!
